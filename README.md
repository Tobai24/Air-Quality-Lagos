# Air-Quality-Lagos
Welcome to the "Air Quality in Lagos Time Series Analysis" repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing and predicting PM2 levels in Lagos, Nigeria, using a dataset sourced from low-cost sensors. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into air quality trends and the effectiveness of these sensors in measuring PM concentrations.
